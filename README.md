# one-to-direct
This bash will turn the link of your files in One Drive to a direct link so that you can directly download them in whatever downloader you want!

To get it to work you're going to have to go to your onedrive and select your desired file. Then click on embed button. It will ask you to generate the HTML code, just generate it! At last, copy the piece of code and run the bash. After choosing one of the options, you will be asked for your embedded links, just paste them there! 

Remember to paste only one link to each line. Also by hitting enter button you will go to next line. When you are done entering them just hold the control button with D button at the same time. There you have it! Now just paste the link in your preferred downloader!
