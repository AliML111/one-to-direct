# one-to-direct
This bash will turn the link of your files in onedrive to a direct link so that you can directly download them in whatever downloader you want!

In order to get it to work you're going to have to go to your onedrive and select your desired file. Then click on embed button. It will ask you for generation of the html code so just generate it! At last copy the piece of code and run the bash. After choosing the option you will be asked for your the embedded links, just paste your links! 

Remember to paste one link to each line and with hitting enter button you will go to next line. When you are done with entering them just hold control button with D button at the same time. There you have it! Now just paste the link in your preferred downloader!
